1.Reading and Writing Text Data to file use all attributes (r,w,r+,w+,ab..etc)

sol:

#program to read from text file
f = open("C:/Users/sanju/Documents/Python/arraycode.txt", "r")
#reading full file
rd = f.read()
#then printing it
print(rd)
f.close()

o/p:
typecode		ctype		minimum size in bytes
'b'		     signed integer		1
'B'		   unsigned integer		1
'i'		     signed integer		2
'I'		   unsigned integer		2
'l'		     signed integer		4
'L'		   unsigned integer		4
'f'		   floating point		4
'd'		  double precision		8
'u'		 unicode character		2

#program to append contents in a file using 'a' mode of open()
f = open("arraycode.txt", "a")
wr=f.write("this line is being appended to the file which was previously created.")
print(wr)
f.close()

#program to write contents into the mentioned file using 'w' mode of open()
f = open("arraycode.txt", "w")
wr=f.write("this file has been created using python write and w mode \n \n next line brought using endline i.e. '\n'")
print(wr)
f.close()

f = open("arraycode.txt", "r+")
rd = f.read()
print(rd)

f = open("arraycode.txt", "w+")
wt = f.write('welcome')
print(wt)

f = open("arraycode.txt", "w+b")
wt = f.write('82964')
print(wt)


2.Printing to a File with a Different Separator or Line Ending


3.Reading and Writing Binary Data

sol:

f = open("arraycode.bin", "wb")
wt = f.write('82964')
print(wt)

f=open("binfile.bin","rb")
num=list(f.read())
print (num)
f.close()


4.Writing to a File That Doesn’t Already Exist

filename = "C:/Users/sanju/Documents/Python/sample.txt"
with open(filename, "w") as f:
    f.write("welcome to new file")


5.Performing I/O Operations on a String

s1=input('enter 1st string:')
s2=input('enter 2nd string:')
print(s1+s2)
print(s1+s2*2)
print(s1*2,s2*2)

o/p:
enter 1st string:sanjeev
enter 2nd string:yaswanth
sanjeevyaswanth
sanjeevyaswanthyaswanth
sanjeevsanjeev yaswanthyaswanth


6.Reading and Writing Compressed Datafiles

#program to read from and write to a compressed file.
import gzip #importing required module
with gzip.open(r'C:\Users\sanju\Desktop\Python Pgms\PYTHON\Python Programming.zip', 'rt') as f:
    text = f.read() #opening and reading the compressed file.
    print(text)
with gzip.open(r'C:\Users\sanju\Desktop\Python Pgms\PYTHON\Python Programming1.zip', 'wt') as f:
    f.write('welcome') #opening and writing to a compressed file.
7.Zip or Unzip in python

import zipfile

print('zip started')
zip_file=zipfile.ZipFile('C:/Users/sanju/Documents/Python/FileZip.zip','w')
zip_file.write('file1.txt',compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
zip_file.write('file2.txt',compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
zip_file.close()
print('zip completed')

unzip_file.extract('file1.txt')
unzip_file.extract('file2.txt')



8.Adding or Changing the Encoding of an Already Open File

f = open("arraycode.txt", "a")
wr=f.write("this line is being appended to the file which was previously created.")
print(wr)
f.close()
